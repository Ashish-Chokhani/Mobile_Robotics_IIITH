# Mobile Robotics

Material from the CSE478 mobile robotics course offered at IIIT Hyderabad in Monsoon 2023.

## Course information

The course introduces the student to fair detail on the basic modules for automating a mobile robot such as state estimation, visual odometry and mapping, planning, and collision avoidance. The course draws upon state of the art practices in probability and statistical methods, optimization techniques and shows how they are dovetailed to a robotics setting. The course has a strong coding component in the form of assignments wherein the student is expected to simulate and implement the algorithms taught in class.

### Pre-requisites

Basic linear algebra, probability theory, and calculus.

### Course topics

**Vision**
Rigid body transformations, Projective geometry, Camera modelling, Camera calibration, Two-view geometry, Stereo, Triangulation, Resection, Visual odometry, Bundle adjustment

**State estimation**
Bayesian filters - Kalman filter, Extended Kalman filter, Localization and Mapping using EKF

**Path planning**
AI-style planning, Kinematics, Randomized planning, Trajectory optimization, Collision avoidance in dynamic environments

_Remark_
Matrix decomposition techniques, such as SVD, QR, RQ, Cholesky, and Linear least squares and Non-linear least squares solvers which will be used throughout the course will be covered as well
