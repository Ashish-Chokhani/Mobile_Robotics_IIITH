    "\n",
    "The global consistency can be evaluated by comparing the absolute distances between estimated and ground truth trajectory. The APE is the error calculated from the difference between the estimated trajectory and the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of calculating the Absolute Pose Error typically involves comparing the absolute distances between the estimated and ground truth trajectory positions. The orientations are compared using the absolute differences in orientation representations, such as quaternions or rotation matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RPE\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative pose error measures the local accuracy of the trajectory over a fixed time interval âˆ†. Therefore, the relative pose error corresponds to the drift of the trajectory which is in particular useful for the evaluation of visual odometry systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the relative pose error, you typically compare the estimated poses obtained at different time instances with the ground truth poses. The relative pose error can be computed using various metrics, such as the Euclidean distance between the estimated and ground truth poses, or the angular difference between their orientations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Absolute Pose Error (APE) and Relative Pose Error (RPE) are both metrics used in the evaluation of the accuracy and consistency of estimated trajectories compared to ground truth trajectories. While they both assess the accuracy of the trajectory estimation, they differ in terms of the scope and the specific type of error they measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we determine if the error is more along the x/y axis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes , we can do that by changing the formulas to calculate the errors and calculate it just along one axis\n",

    "This can help in understanding the predominant direction of the error and provide insights into potential sources of inaccuracies or biases in the trajectory estimation.\n",
